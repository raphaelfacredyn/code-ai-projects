# The Circle - Notes

* mouseX, mouseY?
  * mouseX is the Xcoordinate of the mouse in pixels
  * mouseY is the Ycoordinate of the mouse in pixels
  * this represents a numebr like any other, all math works with it
  * we can put it in the place of peramters
* fill()
  * fill(red, green, blue) (this way of representing colors is called rgb)
  * number ranges form 0 - 255
  * 255, maximum amount of color, 0, no color
  * 255,255,255 is white
  * 0,0,0 is black
  * 255,0,0 is red
  * 100,0,0 is dark red
  * 255,0,255 is pink
  * 100,0,255 is purple
  * google "color picker" to see how rgb works in more detail
  * this is the light color spectrum, colors will not apear same as mixing paint
* background()
  * clears the previous frames
  * and sets the backround color to the color of your choice
  * backgroud(red, green, blue), will be refered to as rgb
  * same color system as fill
