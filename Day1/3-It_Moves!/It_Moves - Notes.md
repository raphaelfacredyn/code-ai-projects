# It Moves! - Notes
#### Variables!

* mouseX, mouseY, width, height are all variables
* and as you can start to tell, variables are at the center of all cool things in programming
* so, do you want to be cool?
* WELL MAKE YOUR OWN VARIABLES!
* variables can have any name you want
* as long as there are no spaces
* and the first character is a letter
* if I want to create a variable called "myIQ"
* then I would write
* var myIQ
* var, means create a new variable, a NEW variable
* now that I created my variable called "myIQ" I want to give it a value
* to do this I just put the name of the variable and set it equal to the value
* myIQ = 25
* but there is a shortcut if you want to create a variable and set its value in one line
* just combine the lines
* var myIQ = 25
* however, right now I am very dumb so lets make me smarter
* myIQ = myIQ + 1000
* now I have an IQ of 1000 more than before and I will take over the earth
