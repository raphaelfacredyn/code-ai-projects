# The Circle - Notes

#### mouseX, mouseY?

* mouseX is the X coordinate of the mouse in pixels
* mouseY is the Y coordinate of the mouse in pixels
* this represents a number like any other, all math works with it
* we can put it in the place of parameters

#### fill()

* fill(red, green, blue) (this way of representing colors is called RGB)
* number ranges form 0 - 255
* 255, maximum amount of color, 0, no color
* 255,255,255 is white
* 0,0,0 is black
* 255,0,0 is red
* 100,0,0 is dark red
* 255,0,255 is pink
* 100,0,255 is purple
* google "color picker" to see how RGB works in more detail
* this is the light color spectrum, colors will not appear same as mixing paint

#### background()

* clears the screen
* and sets the background color to the color of your choice
* background(red, green, blue), will be referred to as RGB
* same color system as fill
